#1. Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Select 
 Case
    When A + B <= C or A + C <= B or B + C <= A then 'Not A Triangle'
    When A = B and B = C then 'Equilateral'
    When A = B or A = C or B = C then 'Isosceles'
    Else 'Scalene'
 END
