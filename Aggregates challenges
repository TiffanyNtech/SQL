#6. Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, 
but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
SELECT CEILING(AVG(salary) - AVG(Replace(salary, '0', '')))
From Employees;

#7. Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 100,000.
Select Count(name) From City Where population > 100000;

#8. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.
Select Max(salary*months), count(*)
From Employee
where salary*months = (select max(salary*months) from employee);

#9. Write a query the following two values from the STATION table:
The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
SELECT Round(sum(LAT_N),2), Round(sum(Long_W),2) From station;

#10. Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880  and less than 137.2345 . Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
Select Round(Sum(LAT_N),4) from station
where Lat_N > 38.7880 and Lat_N < 137.2345;

#11. Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
Select Round(Max(Lat_N),4) from station where Lat_N < 137.2345;

#12. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345 . Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
Select Round(Long_W,4) from station
Where Lat_N < 137.2345
Order by Lat_N Desc Limit 1;
OR   Select Round(Long_W,4) from station
Where Lat_N = (select max(lat_N) from station where Lat_N < 137.2345);

#13. Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7880. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
Select Round(min(lat_N),4) from station where Lat_N > 38.7780;

#14. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7880 . Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
Select ROUND(Long_W,4) from station
where Lat_N = (select min(lat_N) from station where Lat_N > 38.7780);
